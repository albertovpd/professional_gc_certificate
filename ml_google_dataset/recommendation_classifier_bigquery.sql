-- CUSTOMER TARGETING

-- We wish to get more reviews for movieId=96481 which has only one rating and we wish to send coupons to the 100 users who are likely to rate it the highest. Identify those users using:

SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `cloud-training-prod-bucket.movies.movie_recommender`,
    (
    WITH
      allUsers AS (
      SELECT

-- Task 6: Batch predictions for all users and movies

--What if we wish to carry out predictions for every user and movie combination? Instead of having to pull distinct users and movies as in the previous query, a convenience function is provided to carry out batch predictions for all movieId and userId encountered during training.

-- Enter the following query to obtain batch predictions:


SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.RECOMMEND(MODEL `cloud-training-prod-bucket.movies.movie_recommender`)
LIMIT 
  100000

-- Without the LIMIT command the results would be too large to return given the default settings. But the output provides you a sense of the type of predictions that can be made with this model.

-- As seen in a section above, it is possible to filter out movies the user has already seen and rated in the past. The reason already seen movies arenâ€™t filtered out by default is that there are situations (think of restaurant recommendations, for example) where it is perfectly expected that we would need to recommend restaurants the user has liked in the past.
